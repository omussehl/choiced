## Getting Started
Make sure to have an IDE, NPM, and Git installed. We will be using JavaScript to build out this application, with React.js as our UI framework, and Tailwind CSS as a framework for CSS.

To get It running locally:

Clone this repo. Make sure to go to the /mern/client and /mern/server pages since the package.json files are different. To install all required dependencies, do this in the terminal:
```
npm install 
```
To start the local server (this project uses create-react-app): 
```
npm start 
```
This will open up localhost:3000 which is the development server

## MongoDB
MongoDB is used in the backend to store user uploaded collections of data. In the Mern/Server/mongoose.js file, we have our unique mongoDB connect link, which connects the backend to the application. In order to get the server running you must navigate to mern/server and input the following into the terminal:
```
npm run dev
```
## API
The API used is https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability/
We are using the "Search Ultra" version since it provides more data such as the IMDB rating. In order to get the application to work, the API key needs to be pasted into the code.

## Technology used
This will all be downloaded when installing all package dependencies at the beginning. The package.json files gives you the information needed to understand what is being used. This is a MERN (mongoDB, express, react.js, and node.js) application.
